# Active Context

## Current Focus: ✅ API Client Service Refactoring - COMPLETED

### ✅ Completed Tasks

Successfully refactored the existing OpenF1 and Jolpica API services with:

- ✅ New class structures (OpenF1Client, JolpicaClient) with specified method signatures
- ✅ Switched from async httpx to synchronous requests library
- ✅ Parquet caching with date-based filenames in `/features/` directory
- ✅ HTTP retry logic with exponential backoff (2, 4, 8 seconds)
- ✅ Safety Car (SC) and Virtual Safety Car (VSC) lap filtering implemented
- ✅ Comprehensive logging for all API fetches

### ✅ Recent Changes

- Created feature branch: `feature/api-client-refactor`
- Completely rewrote `backend/services/openf1.py` with new OpenF1Client class
- Completely rewrote `backend/services/jolpica.py` with new JolpicaClient class
- Added requests dependency to `pyproject.toml`
- Created `/features/` directory for Parquet cache storage
- Implemented and tested both API clients

### ✅ API Method Signatures Implemented

**OpenF1Client:**

- `get_laps(gp: str, year: int) -> pd.DataFrame`
- `get_pit_events(gp: str, year: int) -> pd.DataFrame`

**JolpicaClient:**

- `get_results(gp: str, year: int) -> pd.DataFrame`
- `get_schedule(year: int) -> pd.DataFrame`

### ✅ Technical Features Implemented

- Synchronous requests with session management
- Exponential backoff retry strategy for HTTP errors
- Cache filename convention: `{gp}_{year}_{date}_{endpoint}.parquet`
- SC/VSC lap filtering based on track status and lap time anomalies
- Comprehensive logging with INFO, WARNING, and ERROR levels
- Context manager support (`with` statements)

### Next Steps

- Set up main branch protection on GitHub (requires repository access)
- Integration testing with real race data
- Performance optimization for large datasets
